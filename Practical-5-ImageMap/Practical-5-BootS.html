                Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating
        responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first
        web sites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is
        the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are
        perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox and Chrome) and for all sizes
        of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). All thanks to
        Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it
        was later declared to be an open-source project.
