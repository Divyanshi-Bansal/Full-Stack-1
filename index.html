          Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application.<br>
          Typically it refers to the HyperText Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and <br>
          JavaScript portion of website production as opposed to the database or server-site programming.<br>
          It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 <br>                 
          design to be accessed via various differnt browers, devices and screen sizes.
